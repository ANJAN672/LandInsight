# Simple Explanation 💡

**What is LandInsight?**
LandInsight is a tool that helps you understand your land better. It's like having a real estate expert and a surveyor in your pocket.

**How we coded it:**
We used **JavaScript** and **Node.js** to build the app. We used special "Map Tools" so it can see shapes you draw. We connected it to **Google's smartest AI** so it can answer your questions.

**Why these tools?**
- **Node.js**: Because it is the most popular and fastest way to build modern websites.
- **Gemini AI**: Because it is the only AI that is smart enough to understand maps and land units.
- **Prisma**: Because it makes sure your data is never lost.

**Why is it smart?**
The app doesn't just "guess". It looks at the actual Earth location (Latitude and Longitude) you provide and matches it with its knowledge of Indian roads, hospitals, and laws.
